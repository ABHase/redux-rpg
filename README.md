Credit to Victor Catalin Torac for the tutorial and code used in generating the procedural dungeon located at https://medium.com/@victorcatalintorac/dungeon-with-rooms-algorithm-for-javascript-ultimate-begginer-guide-ec1489e90314

Incredibly easy to understand code, modified by me and used in producing the first example of the procedural map.


Inside data/maps contains two options for the tiles.

1 can be manually edited to create a static hand drawn map.

2 is a randomly generated dungeon, as of right now manually changing the import in world/index switches between the two.

A todo list will be forth-coming for goals and objectives in the project.
